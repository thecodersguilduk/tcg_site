### Why You Need to Apply

Now more than ever, digital skills training is a great way to open up new opportunities, and give yourself a better chance of enjoying a long, successful career in a digital-first world.

That’s why the government is investing £2.5 billion for the National Skills Fund through the Department for Education, and The Coders Guild is excited to announce that we’ll be a part of this programme. 

Working in partnership with the West Yorkshire Combined Authority (WYCA), we’re providing FREE training courses to help people in the local area gain valuable, relevant digital skills, and support you in realising your full potential for a brighter future. 

We have a long list of businesses of all shapes and sizes across West Yorkshire who are actively looking to hire talented people like you through this programme, with the number of software testing jobs set to rise significantly in 2021.

In addition to direct access to those employers, participants on this course will also come away with: 

* Coaching in modern employability skills, and guidance through testing role-specific hiring processes
* Invitations to employer engagement events, and help finding a job where you can use the testing skills you’ll have learned 
* A high-demand digital skill-set needed by employers across almost every industry and sector today

### What You’ll Learn 

Do you ever get frustrated using the web or apps? (We know we do!) 

Do you use any assistive technologies? 

Software testing is a fantastic way of learning how these things work, while teaching you the skills to improve these kinds of experiences for yourself and others.

Effective software testing and quality assurance are skill-sets which are in demand among many employers right now, and that demand is only set to continue rising in 2021 and beyond.

If you’re a curious person with good attention to detail, or have a process-driven way of thinking, this software testing course could be your first step on the path to a satisfying new career. 

The need for talented software testers and digital quality assurance professionals is growing every day, and this programme will give you all the essential skills and knowledge to take that opportunity. 

You don’t need any previous training, you don’t have to come from a technical background, you don’t even need any proven academic success. All you’ll need is to be comfortable using a computer and willing to learn how to use new applications. 

In the first part of this course you’ll learn what testing means and why it’s important, then you’ll gain practical experience and fundamental knowledge of best practices and common workflows.
