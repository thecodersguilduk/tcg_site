We’re delighted to announce the launch of some new free training courses which will teach valuable tech skills, open to people based in the Liverpool City Region, starting at the end of January.

Working in partnership with the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority, we'd like to invite you to apply to these fantastic digital skills bootcamps which will focus on front-end coding and software development. 

**These courses are completely free, delivered remotely (lockdown-friendly), and taught by experienced professionals with years of experience. They're exclusively available for people aged 19 and over in Liverpool, Wirral, Sefton, Knowsley, St Helens, and Halton.** 

The main purpose of this programme is to make jobs in tech more accessible for people in the BAME community, female candidates, and those who have recently been made redundant or unemployed due to lockdown. But we’re also looking to help people currently in entry-level tech roles progress up the ladder more quickly and easily, as well as introducing people from non-technical backgrounds to the wonderful world of coding.

If that sounds like you, this is the perfect way to put the challenges of 2020 behind you and get the new year off to a positive start.

Spaces are limited, so don’t hesitate to register your interest today!

## Why You Need to Apply

Now more than ever, digital skills training is a great way to boost your employability and give yourself a better chance of enjoying a long, successful career in our digital-first world.

That’s why the government is investing £2.5 billion for the National Skills Fund through the Department for Education, and The Coders Guild is excited to announce that we’ll be part of this programme.

As the country starts to get on the road to recovery from the pandemic, we’ve been tasked with helping people in Liverpool gain valuable, relevant digital skills, which will allow you to realise your full potential for a brighter future in 2021 and beyond.

We have a long list of businesses of all shapes and sizes across the Liverpool City Region who are actively looking to hire talented people like you through this programme, with the large number of coding and developer jobs set to keep rising over the next few years.

In addition to direct access to those employers, participating in these courses will also give you:

* Coaching in modern employability skills, and guidance through hiring processes
* Invitations to employer engagement events, and help finding a job where you can use the skills you’ll have learned
* A high-demand digital skill-set needed by employers today

## Key Details

#### When will the bootcamps run?

* The bootcamps will run between the end of January and March 
* Each bootcamp will last 8 weeks, and will be part-time (roughly between 8 and 16 hours per week on average)
* You can do the work with flexibility, so you can still take part around your current job and any childcare or home-schooling 

#### Where will they be held?

* These bootcamps take place entirely remotely, helping you continue to learn and develop despite the restrictions of lockdown
* We’ll hold a variety of instructor-led seminars, interactive group sessions, more general webinars, and work to do in your own time

#### How will you take part?

* A mixture of virtual classroom-based teaching and training in small groups 
* There will be some work to be completed in your own time
* You’ll work on challenge-based problem solving which will be applicable in future jobs
* Courses are primarily self-driven learning, for your own long-term benefit

#### What else will you learn?

As well as basic coding and key languages for software development, you’ll learn how to collaborate on projects, build cross-functional relationships, and deliver work to a high standard.

And in addition to employability skills, we’ll also help you with job-specific interview preparation, real-world problem solving, and your personal development.

In other words, we’ll get you ready to land the job you’re looking for!

## Deep Dive into the Bootcamps

#### Introduction to Front-End Coding 

This course will show you how the web works, as well as how we design and develop websites and applications for different devices and screen sizes. It will also cover how we make things work for assistive technologies like screen readers and how to work as part of a team to create finished products. 

We’ll be using the tools of the trade to teach you, so you’ll be prepared for hands-on jobs in the near future. We’ll also be building websites with WordPress, the system that powers 62% of all content-managed websites worldwide. You’ll also learn about things like version control and code editors to gain insight into all the processes involved in development. 

This is an ideal pathway to a Level 4 Apprenticeship in software development or a related industry, but could even be used to upskill designers, marketers, or people in other roles with transferable skills.

You won’t need any previous experience with code to do this course. We’ll be starting right at the very beginning, although you should be comfortable using a computer and using online applications. 

<!--
#### Web and App Development with JavaScript and APIs 

The ability to build websites and applications using the JAMStack is something that is in high demand among employers right now, and that demand is only set to continue rising over the next few years. 

With that in mind, this course is ideal for anyone with a basic knowledge of HTML and CSS looking to embrace the future of coding and move forward into a more successful career.

“JAMstack is an architecture designed to make the web faster, more secure, and easier to scale. It builds on many of the tools and workflows which developers love, and which bring maximum productivity.”

On this course, we’ll be recapping the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, as well as teaching accessibility and responsive design principles. We’ll also be looking at how to solve problems with JavaScript, and explore the tools and frameworks which you’ll use to master the skills of modern development.

This is a course for people wanting to move to progress from beginner status coding to launch an exciting new career. Whether you’re just getting started and have dabbled in HTML and CSS before, or are already working in a basic developer role in different languages, this is a great opportunity to learn valuable new skills fast.
