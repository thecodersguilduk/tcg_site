            <p>Most apprentices spend one day a week training, four days a week working in the business. With our fast-track model, we can train your apprentice as many as four days a week, accelerating their progression so they can deliver quality billable work up to three times faster than other schemes. </p>

        <h3 class="mb-6 text-xl leading-lg">Gain far more than just a technical whizz</h3>
        <p class="mb-6">Most software testing apprenticeships focus solely on teaching technical skills, because that’s what’s easy for them, not what’s useful for you. But we also prioritise the real-world personal and professional skills that not only turn your candidates into great software testers, but also into truly valuable members of your business. </p>
        <p class="mb-6">We don’t just teach testing, we teach them how to make a positive impact in the workplace through core skills such as collaboration, problem-solving, communication, time management, best practices, teamwork, and much more.  </p>
