        <h2>A bit about us</h2>
        <p>Back in 2012 a group of developers got together 
        to create a new kind of apprenticeship. We wanted to solve

        This curriculum has now gone through 
        more than 7 years of continuous review and updates. This ensures 
        everything we do is current, useful and relevant.</p>

        <h3 class="mb-6 text-xl leading-lg">It’s the UK’s first industry-led digital apprenticeship</h3>
        <p class="mb-6">We’ve been running since 2013, well before apprenticeships were ‘cool’. 
        We were part of the pilot and trailblazer schemes that determined the 
        format and contents of the new Apprenticeship Standards in Software Testing.</p>

        <h3 class="mb-6 text-xl leading-lg">…and when we say industry-led</h3>
        <p class="mb-6">we actually mean it – all technical training is devised, 
        delivered and under constant review by expert developers. 
        Our Open Source curriculum is 
        <a href="#" class="font-bold text-blue-200">available on GitHub</a>.</p>
