                      <p class="mb-6">With the impact of Covid 19 on the economy we need to upskill the workforce and secure the talent pipeline. One of the best ways to prepare yourself for a post-coronavirus-world is to acquire technology skills.</p>
                      <p class="mb-6">We are working with local authorities and educational organisations to equip young people and assist career changers with acquiring digital and technical skills.</p>
                      <p class="mb-6">Got a techy outreach project? Know of an organisation that is looking to upskill marginalised or underrepresented groups?</p>
