                    <p class="">The Coders Guild Ltd is a lean organisation with highly skilled and capable staff who work in cross-functional teams. We operate a non-hierarchical structure and believe everyone has a voice and should be treated equally. We are based from our offices in Duke Studios in Leeds, however we also work flexibly and remotely using state-of-the-art technology to ensure efficiency, retain quality relationships and continually evolve best practices:</p>
