                    <p class="pl-10">Prior to interview and placement our candidates will receive training 
                          in the fundamental skills of a web developer. Things like problem 
                          solving with code, semantic markup, Git, content management and command line.</p>

                    <p class="pl-10">As soon as they are placed, we need to equip the apprentice with as 
                          many useful, billable skills as possible. They'll receive expert training 
                          in source control and workflows with Git, testing, debugging and accessibility.</p>

                    <p class="pl-10">Next we focus on developing a fundamental understanding of the 
                          tools we use. Automation, Dependency Management, Performance Audits, 
                          Security, etc. At this stage an apprentice will be bringing in more 
                          revenue than they cost.</p>

                    <p class="pl-10">By this time a good amount of the apprentice's time will be on 
                          billable work. We support this by increasing their skills and knowledge 
                          across all areas of the project life cycle. Agile, Scrum, Kanban, Discovery 
                          and Planning, Impact Mapping, etc.</p>

                    <p class="pl-10">At the end of year one apprentices will be working independently 
                          most of the time. We'll move into preparation for lifelong learning by 
                          adding additional knowledge and emerging technologies to their skillset. 
                          APIs, JAMStack, PWA, FP, OOP, etc.</p>
